===============================================================

See changelog, for new additions!

===============================================================

In the future, when Humans ruined Planet Earth by exploiting the resources and un-Stable society undergoing panic, a NASA astronaut named, Dr. Stradford, proposed the idea of shifting a small community of people, containing all ethinic groups, together with few non-human species to a permanent space station. The community named, Joint Earth Space Community (JESC) was setup with Dr. Stradford as Governer-General of JESC. The space station took 26 attempts to successfully build & launch, and finally launched on 14th October 2057, named, The P26 Eartha.

Since, Earth's society was not stable, all communication crashed between P26 Eartha and NASA. After 50 years, unfortunately Planet Earth entered the Second Ice Age! Alarmed by the potential end of Human Race, a special coalition between leading (and existing) World Governments, sent a man named, Kron Exvin to the P26 Eartha, to start the process of evacuvation of Earth's remaining non-criminal people.

Exvin's spacecraft made it to P26 Eartha, but suprisingly it was abandoned!

Now imagine you are Exvin and crack the mystery behind P26 Eartha & its community and find a solution to evacuvate Humankind to the station!


The Truth:

After the launch, Sir Joves terminated the connection between Planet Earth and P26 Eartha. He, with his loyal Night-Walkers, began to rule the station. Roughly, after 2 years, a mysterious disease, named by the crew as The Lins Disease, spread and killed almost all residents of the station.


Around 12 survived, but what happened to them? What happened to Dr. Stradford?


Who spread the disease? Was it aliens or humans? Find out in the full version of the map!
